# Installation

**This library is now supported for both [Vue2](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) versions**

- `vue 2.x`:

```shell
npm i vue-dndrop
```

- `vue 3.x`:

```shell
npm i vue-dndrop@next
```

###### This library consists on a wrapper for Vue.js components over the long missed [smooth-dnd](https://github.com/kutlugsahin/smooth-dnd) library. To make it less _importee_, all the content imported from `smooth-dnd` is now on our own library. It's all plain javascript now.

> Feel free to contribute.
